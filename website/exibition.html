			<p><b>A</b>n exhibition, in the most general sense, is an organised presentation
				 and display of a selection of items. In practice, exhibitions usually occur
				 within a cultural or educational setting such as a museum, art gallery, park, library,
					exhibition hall, or World's fairs. Exhibitions can include many things such as art in both
					major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive exhibitions, natural history museums and history
					 museums, and also varieties such as more commercially focused exhibitions and trade fairs.
					 There are two main types of exhibitions. Trade Exhibitions: Trade exhibitions are designed to meet the
					 needs of one particular type of business or country. Consumer Exhibitions: Consumer exhibitions involve a
					 range of products from a number of different industries on display to the general public.
