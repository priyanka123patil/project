			<p><b>A</b>job fair, also referred commonly as a career fair or career expo, is an
				 event in which employers, recruiters, and schools give information to potential employees.
				  Job seekers attend these while trying to make a good impression to potential coworkers by
					 speaking face-to-face with one another, filling out résumés, and asking questions in attempt to
					  get a good feel on the work needed. Likewise, online job fairs are held, giving job seekers another way to get
						 in contact with probable employers using the internet.
               Job fairs are like speed dating for recruiting. At a set time and place, companies and job seekers meet and try
							 to find out if they’ll match. To make sure you promote yourself at a job fair and attract the most qualified candidates, take
							  some time to plan your job fair recruitment strategy.
