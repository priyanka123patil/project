               Event management is the application of project management
               to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale events such as festivals,
                conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions.
                event management and event planning are two very different functions. The key difference
                lies in these two words: management and planning. In straightforward terms, event managers
                 manage the event and event planners plan the event.
                That being said, event managers may also plan aspects of events and event planners may manage
                 certain components of the event planning process. Event managers and event planners work side
                 by side, and their responsibilities may overlap.
                 Event management involves creating and developing large-scale events which might include conferences,
                 conventions, concerts, trade shows, festivals, and ceremonies. Event management involves identifying the
                  target audience, formulating the event concept, planning the overall logistics of the event and conducting project
                   management of the event as a whole.
